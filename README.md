Welp I am starting the calculator project today, I ended up messng up some other stuff while trying to set this thing up today, so we are off to a great start. I have basic functions set up for basic math and have begun doing the CSS, which I think will def take up a lot of time.

Calculator sizing, and positioning look great, need to get buttons working next.

Okay so I set up a lot of things, but I'm pretty stuck on the display function and holding variabes, I've done it before...I think, trying to get that working now...

Got some assistance with storing the variables for the display, realized my switch statement was incorrect as I had the btn variable listed with no actual .id or .className to refer to. All in all not to bad for today, hope to finish soon.
