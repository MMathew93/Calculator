Welp I am starting the calculator project today, I ended up messng up some other stuff while trying to set this thing up today, so we are off to a great start. I have basic functions set up for basic math and have begun doing the CSS, which I think will def take up a lot of time.

Calculator sizing, and positioning look great, need to get buttons working next.

Okay so I set up a lot of things, but I'm pretty stuck on the display function and holding variabes, I've done it before...I think, trying to get that working now...

Got some assistance with storing the variables for the display, realized my switch statement was incorrect as I had the 'btn' variable listed with no actual .id or .className to refer to. All in all not to bad for today, hope to finish soon.

Skipped Sunday as I was busy, did a lot of Edabit practice instead. Started late today around 7ish due to some other obligations, fixed the calculator display, got the clear function working as well as back space, working on the actual function storing which I have an idea ready for it. Still need to work on updating the display string to update on every input...

I managed to get the equations working as well as the top string to save all inputs. I updated the clear and backspace to fix these new additions accordingly. We are now in the end ame so to speak with trying to get the equal sign button to work. I have an idea of splitting the input string by a regex of equations and then calling each operand function from there, we'll have to see if that works or not later...

Calculations are working, opted for a while loop on calculations to run the whole string, unsure if that is the best method. Need to address multiple operator clicks, and multiple eneter clicks that cause the string to not clear as well as implement decimal into the calculator. I will also need to update the backspace for the decimal too.
